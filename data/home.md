**Welcome to Melkor!**

You are looking at the default wiki homepage. Feel free to edit it.

Some of the features Melkor provides:

* All the pages support markdown formatting
* All changes are stored in a Git repository
* You can comment on individual changes - these get saved as Git commit messages.
* The page layout is responsive. Editing on mobile devices works!

Use [Github-flavoured](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) markdown, including code blocks:

```javascript
function main() {
  alert("Hello Melkor!");
}
```
